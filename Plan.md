This is roughly the plan of preparing for the future of working in tech industry I made for myself. Please be wary that I am more or less okay engineer with long background of working in different companies and some level of people management experience, both at serious setup of companies like eBay and the ambiguity of early stage startups like Screen6 and Montro. This is more of the things I found to do pleasant to give correct signals that others can read.
